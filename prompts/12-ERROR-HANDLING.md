# 12. Error Handling

## Overall approach

- **Try-catch blocks**: Used throughout the application to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.
- **Console logging**: Error details are logged to help diagnose issues during development.
- **User-facing error messages**: Friendly error messages are displayed to users when appropriate.
- **Service/Component-level error handling**: Each major subsystem implements its own error handling strategy.

## Specific Error Handling Strategies

### Main Process

- **Protocol Registration**: Safely handles protocol registration failures.
- **Main Window Creation**: Handles errors during window creation and loading.
- **IPC Communication**: Wraps IPC handlers in try-catch blocks to prevent crashes.
- **Module Availability**: Uses conditional imports and try-catch for platform-specific modules like `electron-squirrel-startup`.
- **Environment Variable Validation**: Checks for required environment variables at startup and shows a dialog for missing ones.

### Renderer Process

- **React Error Boundaries**: Prevent entire UI crashes when components fail.
- **API Calls**: All API calls use proper error handling to show appropriate UI feedback.
- **Audio Processing**: Errors in audio processing are caught and reported without disrupting playback.

### Services

- **ATC Service**: Handles network failures, corrupted files, and API errors.
- **Cache Service**: Manages filesystem errors and handles storage limitations.
- **Audio Service**: Gracefully handles playback and processing errors.

## Crash Recovery

- The application attempts to restore state when possible after unexpected errors.
- User preferences and session data are saved regularly to minimize data loss.
